# C-and-SQL
SQL tutorial finished and C# started. I have 1 year of professional experience using C# and .NET and am getting re-familiarized / acquainted with the language after having been away from it for some time.

This half of the SQL tutorial covered triggers, unions, join, nested queries, wildcards and sum/average among other topics.

I uploaded the SQL commands used in the second half of the tutorial as well as some basic C# using arrays, functions, foreach loops, do/while loops, switch case, try catch and StringBuilder. I will be committing to building some type of real world C# application in the near future that will be open sourced and uploaded here to my github.
