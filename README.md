# C-and-SQL
SQL tutorial finished and C# started.

Uploaded the SQL commands used in the second half of the tutorial as well as some basic C# using arrays, functions, foreach loops, do/while loops, switch case, try catch and StringBuilder. I will be committing to building some type of real world C# application in the near future that will be open sourced and uploaded here to my github.
